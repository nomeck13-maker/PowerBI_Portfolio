# [Project 1: Bicycle Sales Report](https://nomeck13-maker.github.io/PowerBI_Portfolio/)

This is a project I did to showcase my PowerBI skills where I build a story behind data—transforming numbers into insights without requiring people to sift through confusing reports or raw numbers which provides opportunities and insights.

* Data was taken from Financial Sample dataset
* The model shows visualization which where built with the use of DAX and simple measures in PowerBI.
* Report was created to determine the impact of discounted price of the bicycles to profit sales, unit sold and gross sales.
* The project is published on https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/ee0507ed-477b-4ac9-8808-aa8767833591?experience=power-bi
